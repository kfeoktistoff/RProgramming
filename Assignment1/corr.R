## Write a function that takes a directory of data files and a threshold
## for complete cases and calculates the correlation between sulfate and
## nitrate for monitor locations where the number of completely observed
## cases (on all variables) is greater than the threshold. The function
## should return a vector of correlations for the monitors that meet the
## threshold requirement. If no monitors meet the threshold requirement,
## then the function should return a numeric vector of length 0.

corr <- function(directory, threshold = 0) {
  ## 'directory' is a character vector of length 1 indicating
  ## the location of the CSV files
  
  ## 'threshold' is a numeric vector of length 1 indicating the
  ## number of completely observed observations (on all
  ## variables) required to compute the correlation between
  ## nitrate and sulfate; the default is 0
  
  ## Return a numeric vector of correlations
